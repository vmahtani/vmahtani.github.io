"I don't think it's smart to rush him into games," Nash said Wednesday. "There's only 50 games left. It's when he's ready. If he's ready for Indiana, great. If he's not, we push it to the next one."<br /> <br />Joe Harris SF Nov 29 Out Coach Steve Nash said Monday that Harris will undergo left ankle surgery, but he is expected to return this season, Shams Charania of The Athletic reports.</h4>
